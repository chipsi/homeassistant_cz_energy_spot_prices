# Home Assistant Czech Energy Spot Prices

Home Assistant integration that provides current Czech electricity spot prices based on [OTE](ote-cr.cz).

2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Open Settings -> Devices & Services -> Integration

## Displaying a chart

If you want you display a chart with current day (or two days if it's after noon), you can install [apexcharts-card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) card for Home Assistant and then use following config for it:

```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
header:
  show: true
  show_states: true
  colorize_states: true
graph_span: 2d
span:
  start: day
now:
  show: true
  label: Now
series:
  - entity: sensor.current_spot_electricity_price
    type: column # or "line" if you prefer
    show:
      in_header: raw
    data_generator: |
      return Object.entries(entity.attributes).map(([date, value], index) => {
        return [new Date(date).getTime(), value];
      });
```
